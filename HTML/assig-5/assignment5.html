    <p>Cooking is the art and science of preparing food by combining ingredients and applying heat. It transforms raw ingredients into meals that nourish the body and bring people together. Whether it's a simple home-cooked dish or a gourmet creation, cooking allows for creativity, experimentation, and cultural expression. It's both a practical skill and a form of self-care.</p>
